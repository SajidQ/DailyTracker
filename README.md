##Notes

###2/25/17
This is a project to play around with JS, angularjs, but mostly the Google Calendar API. Additionally, I'm planning to use this to maybe track goals outside of journaling using one location, google calendar.

The initial objective is to show the 24hours of today and tomorrow broken up in 30min intervals. This will also enable users to write yearly, monthly, weekly goals.

Objective: Have goals and action in one place?
