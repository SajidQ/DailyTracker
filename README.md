##Notes
### Week of 2/27/17
3/2/17 - It seems like a better idea to add a calendar labeled DailyTrackerJS so it doesn't interfere with other calendars the user has. In addition, it might be better to show a layering of the other tasks from the calendar?
Tasks to add: get list of calendars, check if DailyTracker calendar is a part of list, if not add it, grab all the tasks from the DailyTracker and show on the hourly today list. Additionally, grab tasks from other calendars and layer it on top of hourly today list.

3/1/17 - Adding in another js file for services in order to keep the mainCtrl clean.

2/28/17 - Worked on cleaning up and showing the hours. I'm having a hard time imagining the design with goals, the hourly display of today and tomorrow, and the habits. I really want to add things like habit-tracking and maybe connect to Wunderlist. The current index.html page is likely to become a dashboard page with the other header links providing more editing features for lists..?

###Week of 2/20/17
2/26/17 - Goal: Change what's shown on the screen based on authorization. Start setting up the UI for Today (hourly) and the Goals.

2/25/17 - This is a project to play around with JS, angularjs, but mostly the Google Calendar API. Additionally, I'm planning to use this to maybe track goals outside of journaling using one location, google calendar.

The initial objective is to show the 24hours of today and tomorrow broken up in 30min intervals. This will also enable users to write yearly, monthly, weekly goals.

Objective: Have goals and action in one place?
