##Notes

###3/1/17
Adding in another js file for services in order to keep the mainCtrl clean. 

###2/28/17
Worked on cleaning up and showing the hours. I'm having a hard time imagining the design with goals, the hourly display of today and tomorrow, and the habits. I really want to add things like habit-tracking and maybe connect to Wunderlist. The current index.html page is likely to become a dashboard page with the other header links providing more editing features for lists..?

###2/26/17
Goal: Change what's shown on the screen based on authorization. Start setting up the UI for Today (hourly) and the Goals.

###2/25/17
This is a project to play around with JS, angularjs, but mostly the Google Calendar API. Additionally, I'm planning to use this to maybe track goals outside of journaling using one location, google calendar.

The initial objective is to show the 24hours of today and tomorrow broken up in 30min intervals. This will also enable users to write yearly, monthly, weekly goals.

Objective: Have goals and action in one place?
